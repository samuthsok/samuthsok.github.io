    <h3>A Note on Liam</h3>
    <p>Liam is the youngest child of four. He is two and a half years old and wears size toddler three in clothes. He learned his ABC's from wathcing baby alphabetic songs on Youtube since he was barely a year and a half. Both upper case and lower case. Now a year later, he knows how to read some basic words such as most colors, shapes, his name and all of his families names just to name a few. His parents did not know he aquired this skill at his age until he read some words out loud as he came across the onces he knew.</p>
